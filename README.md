# HadesModding
A tutorial and documentation project for data mining and modding Supergiant's action rougelike: Hades. Hades is Supergiant's new early access title, scheduled for release sometime in late 2020. You can pick it up on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/) or [The Epic Game Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/hades/home). It's a blisteringly fast pace action rougelite and I've put about 50 hours into it. It's 24.99 right now while it's still in early access and I find it to be the best rougelike I've ever played (Yes, even better than dead cells 0_0). If you haven't played the game and are reading this right now, go pick it up and give it a few runs yourself!

Supergiant games has also chosen not to obfuscate most of the scripting language that drives the game of Hades either, this encourages and makes it way easier to mod and there is allready a tight knit community of modding just getting started on this game. There is a lot of data to shift through however, and I'm learning a lot as well. This project will serve as my journal of interesting information and starting guide for how to mod Hades. And maybe it will be a useful resource for the community :)

## A quick note on version numbers
Every file in the project will start with the version number of the game as displayed on the opening screen. This is the patch that the current file was built on, and thus may be out of date once new patches come out.

## README.md and contents file
Each directory will have a README.md describing the general contents of directories of the directories
* modding/: Describes how to get started with actually installing and creating mods
* data/: Describes different data files within the contents files.
* mechanics/: A set of guides on various aspects of the mechanics within the game.
